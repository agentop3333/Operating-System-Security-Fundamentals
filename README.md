#  Operating System Security Fundamentals

## Objective
Understand OS-level security by configuring users, permissions, firewall, and services.

## Environment
- Ubuntu Linux (VirtualBox VM)

## What I Did
- Explored user roles and privileges
- Configured file permissions using chmod and chown
- Enabled and configured UFW firewall
- Identified and disabled unnecessary services
- Documented OS hardening checklist

## Key Learnings
- Least privilege reduces damage from compromise
- File permissions are critical for data protection
- Disabling unused services reduces attack surface
